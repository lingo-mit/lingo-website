We're interested in machine learning for language understanding, and in language
as a source of supervision for general machine learning problems. We develop
techniques for learning from instructions, explaining decisions, and
generalizing in human-like ways from small amounts of data. Learn more about
[who we are](people.html) and [what we're thinking about](research.html)!
